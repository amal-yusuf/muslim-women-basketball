                <p>Created by Muslim women for Muslim women (and others), Muslim Women’s Basketball caters to our needs by providing an environment for us to be our genuine selves; share our narrative and create a community of role models for the next generation</p>
            </div>
                <div>
                    <p>We provide opportunities for women to play basketball at different levels through scrimmage sessions; training sessions and beginner sessions and we hope to build on the progress by establishing coaching courses, referee courses and other officiating courses so that Muslim Women are visibly part of every aspect of the basketball world.</p>
