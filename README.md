Bugs 

Solved bugs:

The project was not responsive on small screen devices, my mentor Mr Gerard Mcbride has given a valuable advice to add media query style for small devices: the navigation bar { display: inline-block;
margin-right: 20%; 
}. and to make it scale; html,body{
  overflow-x: hidden;
  overflow-y: auto;
} and it has been fixed.
